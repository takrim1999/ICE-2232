Heres the algorithms for operations used in Linear Arrays
1. Traversing
    [Using While loop with Array A]    
    
    Step 1. [Initialize counter] Set K := LB
    Step 2. [repeatation with while loop] Repeat step 3 and 4 While A[K] <= UB
    Step 3.     [Opening elements] Apply PROCESS to A[K]
    Step 4.     [Incriment the counter] Set K := K + 1
    Step 5. [After completing Step 2 loop] Exit.

    [Using For loop with Array A] 
    Step 1. [repeatation using for loop] Repeat step 2 for K := LB to UB
    Step 2.     [Opening elements] Apply PROCESS to A[K]
    Step 3. [After completing Step 1 loop] Exit.

2. Searching
    As a very big part it'll be completed in another folder

3. Insertion
    INSERT(LA,N,K,ITEM) [Insert ITEM at Kth element of LA[N]]

    Step 1. [Initialize counter] Set J := K
    Step 2. [Loop] Repeat Step 3 and 4 While J >= K
    Step 3.     [Move elements downward] Set LA[J+1] := LA[J]
    Step 4.     [Decreament counter] Set J = J - 1
                [After completing Loop of Step 2]
    Step 5. [Inserting element] Set LA[K] := ITEM
    Step 6. [Reset size] Set N = N + 1
    Step 7. Exit 

4. Deletion
    DELETE(LA,N,K,ITEM) [Delete Kth element from LA[N]]

    Step 1. [Keeping the element going be deleted] Set ITEM := LA[K]
    Step 2. [Using for loop to repeat] Repeat Step 3 for Set J = K to N-1
    Step 3.     [Moving elements upward] LA[J]=LA[J+1]
                [End of loop from Step 2]
    Step 4. [Reset size] N = N - 1
    Step 5. Exit

5. Updating
    UPDATE(LA,N,K,ITEM) [Update Kth element of LA[N] with ITEM]

    Step 1. [change element of Kth position with ITEM] Set LA[K] := ITEM
    Step 2. Exit

6. Sorting
    As a very big part it'll be completed in another folder
7. Merging
    As a very big part it'll be completed in another folder
